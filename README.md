# KNN_surfaceDefects
Implementation for KNN classifier for surface defects in metal sheets 

# Description 
6 different surface defects obtained from NEU surface defect database are classified using KNN algorithm with modified enhacements in preprocessing module for higher accuracy , Overall Accuracy of classification is up to 80%

# K-loop
You can also modify the code to see the effect of changing of K on the accuracy and computation expense , A text file is generated for all acquired results

# Requirements

OpenCV 3.X
Numpy
Sklearn
imutils
